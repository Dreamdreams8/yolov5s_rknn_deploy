## RKNPU2
  RKNPU2 provides an advanced interface to access Rockchip NPU.
  
## Support Platform
  - RK3566
  - RK3568
  
Note: The content of this project is not applicable to RK1808/RV1109/RV1126/RK3399Pro.
      The rknn model must be generated using RKNN Toolkit 2 instead of RKNN Toolkit.

## ReleaseLog

### 1.1.0
   - Support INT8+FP16 mixed quantization to improve model accuracy
   - Support specifying input and output dtype, which can be solidified into the model
   - Support multiple inputs of the model with different channel mean/std
   - Improve the stability of multi-thread + multi-process runtime
   - Support flashing cache for fd pointed to internal tensor memory which are allocated by users
   - Improve dumping internal layer results of the model
   - Add rknn_server application as proxy between PC and board
   - Support more operators, such as HardSigmoid、HardSwish、Gather、ReduceMax、Elu
   - Added LSTM support (structure cifg and peephole are not supported, function: layernormal, clip is not supported)
   - Bug fix
